# group_recommendation


#Group recommender systems try to support a group of users in making decisions based on a selection of options. New solutions work by first collecting individual preferences prior to the actual decision-making process and suggesting items that fit the plural model. In this article, we take a different approach, implemented in a system that records and uses user preferences when team members discuss options. The system monitors user interactions and offers appropriate directions and recommendations. In this study, a recommender algorithm is presented, in which a certain number of items can be suggested to a group of users. The problem of group recommendation naturally arises in many real-world contexts, and one of its problems is choosing a recommendation for a group of user communities. In this paper, the problem of group recommendation as a subgroup of individuals with the highest group score in a matrix diagram is investigated and a fast greedy algorithm is used to find subgroups.
